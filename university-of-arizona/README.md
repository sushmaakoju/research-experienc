## Research Assistant, for a DARPA project, at Clulab, University of Arizona. Aug 19th, 2022 - July 22nd, 2023

## Teaching Assistant, CSC 473 Automata, Grammars and Languages, Aug 2023 - May 2023

I worked as Teaching Assistant for CSC 473 Automata, Grammars and Languages taught by Prof. Cesim Erten. As a Teaching Assistant, I had regular duties like any other students. **Prof. Cesim Erten mentored me and I learnt a lot by also reading research works.** It was greatly helpful.

- I previously studied this subject out of interest in languages theory.
- Learning from students' questions as well as helping them with concepts had been a great experience. Main goal is to make the subject fun for students with reduced stress levels.
- For more details on this, please refer: <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/university-of-arizona/TA-work-summary.md">TA Work summary</a>

## Spring 2024 completed courses & course Projects

I worked on short literature review on Adaptive Machine Unlearning. 
<a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/university-of-arizona/csc-588-project-report-sushma-akoju.pdf">
This is mainly to set the foundations for unlearning methods in Large Language Models.
I also worked on studying unlearning approached on LLMs such as unlearning Harry Potter novels and verifying if the LLM can be probed for any keywords from Harry Potter world.

- to include the report for the unlearning in LLMs.

### 🏆Acheivements as a Teaching Assistant

- I proposed ideas to conduct syllabus-driven Supplemental Instruction sessions for practice, add quizzes in-class, idea to accomodate points for piazza questions and answers from students in October 2023 were actually implemented in Spring 2024.

- I planned to continue studying stress among students for this course provided resources and if that really helps/helped them to reduce stress and improve scores. So I work on this as part of **Teaching as a Research (TAR) course** is part of CIRTL, taught by Instructors Kristin Winet and Byron Richard Hempel and I am grateful for amazing instructors.

- **During Fall 2023**, it became a Spiritual quest for me. So at one point there was a question on Left Quotient problem. I quickly found a research paper on this and I had the answer. So I read about Transducers before, so it was easier to connect about Transducers that can solve some Quotient problems of languages. So I used Transducers to come up with a solution to **visually explain to the students**.

- Implementing these ideas is a lot of hard work and I am truly grateful for working with Prof. Cesim Erten.
