## Note about programming

I am truly grateful that a lot of people contacted me and genuinely like to support for my career opportunities for me. I really appreciate your support and I have nothing but gratitude and appreciation for your support.


A lot of people, have been contacting me recently, about implying I should be an "Applied Scientist" or a "Programmer". When I completed my 3rd Masters degree program in USA, I received job offers to design and teach AI/Natural Language processing courses at High Schools and private corporate Institutions as well as "Applied scientist" job offers. As a graduate from 3 Master's programs in STEM related programs, I think we are not allowed to teach on H1B. These job options were available to me since 2022, even before I started my PhD and I would like to emphasize these are less known facts.

However now that I am pursuing my PhD, based on the feedback from my long-term mentors and people I worked with, I have planned for a career that better suits my skills, based on my well-evaluated experiences, that align with my **research work** and **research goals**. 

About my first assignment as a research programmer: <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/tree/main/carnegie-mellon-university#note">Note</a>

Here is a teaching-as-research project case study I worked on from Fall 2023 to Spring 2024:
