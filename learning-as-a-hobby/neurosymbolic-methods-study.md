## Learning as a hobby: Neurosymbolic Methods in AI

The reason for putting this together now is to confront some of the stereotypes and biases, I felt compelled to share the following learning relevant information. We do not have to put everything on the internet to "demonstrate" proof of study and understanding when safety and privacy is not guaranteed. And this page is - NOT for Intellectual domination, NOT for power, and most importantly NOT for profit/gains/promotion of any sort. **The following proofs of studies are added only to address atleast some concerns and questions that - I, my mentors and friends - receive about showing online/internet proofs of my study, so those concerns are put to rest.**
