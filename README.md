## Disclaimer

I **did NOT** give any consent to anyone to use my name and my works for any promotion, for any competitive advantages, for commercial use, for professional gains and for any monetary proposals before and now. I have very limited social network presence. Recently there seems to be an increase in misuse of advanced technology such as sockpuppeting for circumventing restrictions (to gain access to information not disclosed to the specific individual), impersonation, falsification, IP infringement, so on. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13843?">Refer: Misuse taxonomy</a> and <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/mapping-the-misuse-of-generative-ai/">categories of misuse</a>. The consequences could lead to misappropriation of name/electronic media/misdirected moral outrage as a shortcut to bypass competition/legal restrictions and misuse of AI or organizational anonymous reporting tools for deception/for spreading misinformation/false allegations. (<a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/causes.md">causes</a>). With limited social network presence, access to such personal information has to be from stalking/cyberstalking or misuse of technology/AI that violate specific restrictions. It would only be a matter of time, such attempts of misuse of technology/stalking eventually comes out. We cannot afford to punish targeted individuals of whom the false information has been perpetrated. Asking victims i.e. targeted individuals to prove perpetrated false information/allegations was false, parallels exact same experience as punishment for a mistake not done by them. Don't fall prey to false information. Protect yourself. Be smart! I did not have any for-profit or explicit agreements for promotion before and now. I **did NOT** apply for full time jobs as I am pursuing my PhD at the moment and I would consider applying for a different type of jobs closer to my graduation, thanks!!
