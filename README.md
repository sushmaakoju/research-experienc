## Disclaimer

I **did NOT** give any consent to anyone to use my name and my works for any promotion, for any competitive advantages, for commercial use, for professional gains and for any monetary proposals before and now. I have very limited social network presence. Recently there seems to be an increase in misuse of advanced technology such as sockpuppeting for circumventing restrictions (to gain access to information not disclosed to the specific individual), impersonation, falsification, IP infringement, so on. <b>Prebunking</b> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13843?">Misuse taxonomy</a> and <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/mapping-the-misuse-of-generative-ai/">categories of misuse</a>. The consequences of misuse of advanced technology/AI could lead to misappropriation of name/electronic media, misdirected moral outrage as a shortcut to bypass competition/legal restrictions, false promotion/hype, presenting false dichotomies, misuse of AI/misuse of organizational anonymous reporting tools for deception, spreading misinformation/false allegations and so on. (<a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/causes.md">causes</a>). If a person has limited social network presence, then someone who tries to gain access to that person's restricted information, will have to be from stalking/cyberstalking. It would only be a matter of time, such attempts of misuse of technology/stalking eventually comes out. We cannot afford to punish targeted individuals of whom the false information was perpetrated. Asking victims i.e. targeted individuals to prove perpetrated allegations were false, parallels exact same experience as punishment for a mistake not committed by them. Don't fall prey to false information. Protect yourself. Be smart!! This is just for prebunking the misuse of technology. I did not have any for-profit or explicit agreements for promotion before and now. I **did NOT** apply for full time jobs as I am pursuing my PhD at the moment and I would consider applying for a different type of jobs closer to my graduation, thanks!!
